# Tilt

Born at [Hacker School](http://www.hackerschool.com/)

## Scroll web pages without lifting a finger (lift your laptop instead)

Tilt is a Chrome extension that lets you scroll web pages by tilting your accelerometer-equipped laptop forward and backward. It was inspired by the tilt scrolling feature of Instapaper (which I hear is also in Chrome for Android).

## Howâ€™s it doing?

Ready for release. I hope.
